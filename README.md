<br/>

## Remarks

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> This is an unofficial library. **Stability.ai** does not provide any official library for `Delphi`.
> This repository contains `Delphi` implementation over [Stability.ai](https://platform.stability.ai/docs/api-reference/) public API.

<br/>

# Stability AI console

You can access the [Stability.ai console](https://platform.stability.ai/) to explore the available possibilities.

To obtain an API key, you need to create an account. A credit of 25 will be granted to you, and an initial key will be automatically generated. You can find this key [here](https://platform.stability.ai/account/keys).

Once you have a token, you can initialize `IStabilityAI` interface, which is an entry point to the API.

> [!NOTE]
>```Pascal
>uses StabilityAI;
>
>var Stability := TStabilityAIFactory.CreateInstance(API_KEY);
>```

>[!Warning]
> To use the examples provided in this tutorial, especially to work with asynchronous methods, I recommend defining the stability interface with the widest possible scope.
><br/>
> So, set `Stability := TStabilityAIFactory.CreateInstance(API_KEY);` in the `OnCreate` event of your application.
><br/> 
>Where `Stability: IStabilityAI;`

<br/>

# Asynchronous callback mode management

In the context of asynchronous methods, for a method that does not involve streaming, callbacks use the following generic record: `TAsynCallBack<T> = record` defined in the `StabilityAI.Async.Support.pas` unit. This record exposes the following properties:

```Pascal
   TAsynCallBack<T> = record
   ... 
       Sender: TObject;
       OnStart: TProc<TObject>;
       OnSuccess: TProc<TObject, T>;
       OnError: TProc<TObject, string>; 
```
<br/>

The name of each property is self-explanatory; if needed, refer to the internal documentation for more details.

> [!NOTE]
>In the rest of the tutorial, we will primarily use anonymous methods unless otherwise specified, as working with APIs requires it due to processing times that can sometimes be quite long.
>

<br/>

# Generate

## Stable Image Ultra

**Stable Image Ultra** use the Diffusion 3.5 model. This method is distinguished by:

- **Advanced Prompt Understanding:** Fine and precise analysis of descriptions, even complex ones.
- **Typography Mastery:** Ability to integrate readable and aesthetically pleasing text elements.
- **Complex Compositions:** Harmonious management of detailed, multi-element scenes.
- **Dynamic Lighting:** Rendering of natural, dramatic, or artistic lighting effects.
- **Vibrant Colors:** Rich palettes, dynamic nuances, and visual depth.
- **Cohesion and Structure:** Creation of balanced, well-structured images with no inconsistencies.

### Text to image

**Asynchronous Code Example**

```Pascal
//uses StabilityAI, StabilityAI.Types, StabilityAI.Common, StabilityAI.StableImage.Generate;

  Stability.StableImage.Generate.ImageUltra(
    procedure (Params: TStableImageUltra)
    begin
      Params.AspectRatio(ratio16x9);
      Params.Prompt('Lighthouse on a cliff overlooking the ocean');
      //A blurb of text describing what you do not wish to see in the output image.
      //Params.NegativePrompt('...')
      Params.OutputFormat(png);
    end,
    function : TAsynStableImage
    begin
      //Add a TImage on the form
      //Add a TMemo on the form
      Result.Sender := Image1;

      Result.OnStart :=
        procedure (Sender: TObject)
        begin
          Memo1.Lines.Text := Memo1.Text + 'The generation has started. Please wait...' + sLineBreak;
        end;

      Result.OnSuccess :=
        procedure (Sender: TObject; Image: TStableImage)
        begin
          var Stream := Image.GetStream;
          try
            Image.SaveToFile('lighthouse.png');
            //for VCL 
            Image1.Picture.LoadFromStream(Stream);
            //for FMX
            //Image1.Bitmap.LoadFromStream(Stream);
            Memo1.Lines.Text := Memo1.Text + 'Generation ended successfully' + sLineBreak;
          finally
            Stream.Free;
          end;
        end;

      Result.OnError :=
        procedure (Sender: TObject; Error: String)
        begin
          Memo1.Lines.Text := Memo1.Text + Error + sLineBreak;
        end;
    end);
```

### Tools for simplifying this tutorial

To simplify the example codes provided in this tutorial, I have included two units in the source code: `VCL.Stability.Tutorial` and `FMX.Stability.Tutorial`. Depending on the option you choose to test the provided source code, you will need to instantiate either the `TVCLStabilitySender` or `TFMXStabilitySender` class in the application's `OnCreate` event, as follows:

>[!TIP]
>```Pascal
>//uses VCL.Stability.Tutorial;
>
>  StabilityResult := TVCLStabilitySender.Create(Memo1, Image1);
>```
>
>or
>
>```Pascal
>//uses FMX.Stability.Tutorial;
>
>  StabilityResult := TFMXStabilitySender.Create(Memo1, Image1);
>```
>

Make sure to add a `TMemo` and a `TImage` component to your form beforehand.

<br/>

### Image and text to image

It is also possible to provide a reference image to use as a starting point for generation. In this case, the `strength` parameter must be specified, as it determines the influence of the input image on the final output. A `strength` value of 0 will produce an image identical to the input, while a value of 1 indicates no influence from the initial image.

```Pascal
//uses StabilityAI, StabilityAI.Types, StabilityAI.Common, StabilityAI.StableImage.Generate, FMX.Stability.Tutorial;

  StabilityResult.FileName := 'lighthouse1.png';

  Stability.StableImage.Generate.ImageUltra(
    procedure (Params: TStableImageUltra)
    begin
      Params.AspectRatio(ratio16x9);
      Params.Prompt('There are many birds in the sky');
      Params.Image('lighthouse.png');
      Params.Strength(0.3);
      Params.OutputFormat(png);
    end,
    function : TAsynStableImage
    begin
      Result.Sender := StabilityResult;
      Result.OnStart := Start;
      Result.OnSuccess := Display;
      Result.OnError := Display;
    end);
```

<br/>

## Stable Image Core
**Specificity:**
- `Stable Image Core` is a text-to-image generation service designed to deliver premium quality with speed. Unlike other similar tools, it requires no expertise in "prompt engineering."

<br/>

### Image Core Create

**Asynchronous Code Example**

```Pascal
//uses StabilityAI, StabilityAI.Types, StabilityAI.Common, StabilityAI.StableImage.Generate, FMX.Stability.Tutorial;

  StabilityResult.FileName := 'lighthouse2.png';

  Stability.StableImage.Generate.ImageCore(
    procedure (Params: TStableImageCore)
    begin
      Params.AspectRatio(ratio16x9);
      Params.Prompt('Lighthouse on a cliff overlooking the ocean');
      Params.OutputFormat(png);
    end,
    function : TAsynStableImage
    begin
      Result.Sender := StabilityResult;
      Result.OnStart := Start;
      Result.OnSuccess := Display;
      Result.OnError := Display;
    end);
```

Detailed settings on the [official documentation](https://platform.stability.ai/docs/api-reference#tag/Generate/paths/~1v2beta~1stable-image~1generate~1core/post)

<br>

### Using a preset style

You can guide the image model toward a specific style by selecting from 17 available styles.

```Pascal
//uses StabilityAI, StabilityAI.Types, StabilityAI.Common, StabilityAI.StableImage.Generate, FMX.Stability.Tutorial;

  StabilityResult.FileName := 'lighthouse3.png';

  Stability.StableImage.Generate.ImageCore(
    procedure (Params: TStableImageCore)
    begin
      Params.AspectRatio(ratio16x9);
      Params.Prompt('Lighthouse on a cliff overlooking the ocean');
      Params.StylePreset(TStylePreset.digitalArt);
      Params.OutputFormat(png);
    end,
    function : TAsynStableImage
    begin
      Result.Sender := StabilityResult;
      Result.OnStart := Start;
      Result.OnSuccess := Display;
      Result.OnError := Display;
    end);
```

<br/>

## Stable Diffusion

Inventory of available models

**Stable Diffusion 3.5**
- **SD3.5 Large:** Flagship model with 8 billion parameters, delivering exceptional image quality and precise prompt adherence. Ideal for professional use at 1-megapixel resolution.
- **SD3.5 Large Turbo:** A distilled version of **SD3.5 Large**, designed for fast image generation in just 4 steps, while maintaining high quality and excellent prompt fidelity. Perfect for projects requiring quick execution.
- **SD3.5 Medium:** Mid-tier model with 2.5 billion parameters, offering an optimal balance between prompt accuracy and image quality. Best suited for fast and efficient performance.

<br/>

**Stable Diffusion 3.0** (Fireworks AI)
- **SD3 Large:** Model with 8 billion parameters, providing professional-grade performance similar to **SD3.5 Large**.
- **SD3 Large Turbo:** Optimized version for faster execution while maintaining high-quality output.
- **SD3 Medium:** Model with 2 billion parameters, balancing quality and speed for less intensive use cases.

<br/>

**Key Points:**
- **Parameter Count:** Indicates the modelâs power (8B for Large, 2â2.5B for Medium).
- **Speed:** `Turbo` versions generate images faster without sacrificing quality.
- **Applications:** Large models are perfect for detailed and professional projects, while Medium models are ideal for quick, balanced tasks.

<br/>

### Generating with a prompt

This mode creates an image based solely on a textual description. The `prompt` is the only mandatory input, but an optional `aspect_ratio` parameter is available to adjust the dimensions of the resulting image.

**Asynchronous Code Example**

```Pascal
//uses StabilityAI, StabilityAI.Types, StabilityAI.Common, StabilityAI.StableImage.Generate, FMX.Stability.Tutorial;

  StabilityResult.FileName := 'lighthouse4.png';

  Stability.StableImage.Generate.Diffusion(
    procedure (Params: TStableImageDiffusion)
    begin
      Params.AspectRatio(ratio16x9);
      Params.Prompt('Lighthouse on a cliff overlooking the ocean');
      Params.OutputFormat(png);
    end,
    function : TAsynStableImage
    begin
      Result.Sender := StabilityResult;
      Result.OnStart := Start;
      Result.OnSuccess := Display;
      Result.OnError := Display;
    end);
```

Detailed settings on the [official documentation](https://platform.stability.ai/docs/api-reference#tag/Generate/paths/~1v2beta~1stable-image~1generate~1sd3/post)

<br/>

### Generating with a prompt and an image

This method generates an image based on text input while using an existing image as the initial reference. The necessary parameters include:
- `prompt`: the descriptive text that guides the image generation.
- `image`: the starting image that serves as the foundation for the output.
- `strength`: determines the degree to which the starting image influences the final result.
- `mode`: should be set to "image-to-image".

**Asynchronous Code Example**

```Pascal
//uses StabilityAI, StabilityAI.Types, StabilityAI.Common, StabilityAI.StableImage.Generate, FMX.Stability.Tutorial;

  StabilityResult.FileName := 'lighthouse5.png';

  Stability.StableImage.Generate.Diffusion(
    procedure (Params: TStableImageDiffusion)
    begin
      Params.Prompt('There are many birds in the sky');
      Params.Mode(imageToImage);
      Params.Image('lighthouse4.png');
      Params.Strength(0.6);
      Params.OutputFormat(png);
    end,
    function : TAsynStableImage
    begin
      Result.Sender := StabilityResult;
      Result.OnStart := Start;
      Result.OnSuccess := Display;
      Result.OnError := Display;
    end);
```

>[!NOTE]
> Note: maximum request size is 10MiB.
>

<br/>

### Optional Parameters

Both modes allow the use of these optional parameters:
- `model`: Specifies the model to utilize, such as **SD3 Large**, **SD3 Large Turbo**, or **SD3 Medium**.
- `output_format`: Determines the desired format of the resulting image.
- `seed`: Sets the randomness seed for the generation process.
- `negative_prompt`: Defines keywords to exclude from the generated image.
- `cfg_scale`: Adjusts the level of adherence to the prompt text during the diffusion process.

<br/>

## SDXL and SD version 1

### Text to image prompting

**Using SDXL 1.0:** Use `stable-diffusion-xl-1024-v1-0` as the `engine_id` for your request, and specify the dimensions (`height` and `width`) with one of the following combinations:
- **1024x1024** (default)
- **1152x896**
- **896x1152**
- **1216x832**
- **1344x768**
- **768x1344**
- **1536x640**
- **640x1536**

<br/>

**Using SD 1.6**: SD 1.6 is a flexible-resolution base model designed for generating images with non-standard aspect ratios. The model is optimized for a resolution of 512 x 512 pixels. To create outputs with a resolution of 1 megapixel, we recommend using SDXL 1.0, which is available at the same price.

To use this model, set `stable-diffusion-v1-6` as the `engine_id` in your request and ensure the `height` and `width` meet the following requirements:
- Each dimension must be at least 320 pixels.
- No dimension can exceed 1536 pixels.
- Dimensions must be in increments of 64.
- The default resolution is 512 x 512 pixels.

<br/>

**Asynchronous Code Example**

```Pascal
//uses 
//  StabilityAI, StabilityAI.Types, StabilityAI.Common, StabilityAI.StableImage.Generate, 
//  StabilityAI.Version1.SDXL1AndSD1_6, FMX.Stability.Tutorial; 

  StabilityResult.FileName := 'lighthouse6.png';

  Stability.Version1.SDXLAndSDL.TextToImage('stable-diffusion-xl-1024-v1-0',
    procedure (Params: TPayload)
    begin
      Params.TextPrompts([TPrompt.New(1, 'A lighthouse on a cliff') ]);
      Params.CfgScale(7);
      Params.Height(1216);
      Params.Width(832);
      Params.Sampler(TSamplerType.K_DPMPP_2S_ANCESTRAL);
      Params.Samples(1);
      Params.Steps(30);
    end,
    function : TAsynArtifacts
    begin
      Result.Sender := StabilityResult;
      Result.OnStart := Start;
      Result.OnSuccess := Display;
      Result.OnError := Display;
    end);
```

<br/>

### Image to image with prompt

**Adjusting the Degree of Transformation**
- To retain approximately 35% of the original image in the final output, you can use either of these approaches: set `init_image_mode=IMAGE_STRENGTH` with `image_strength=0.35`, or use `init_image_mode=STEP_SCHEDULE` with `step_schedule_start=0.65`. Both methods yield similar results, but the `step_schedule` mode offers additional flexibility by allowing you to specify a `step_schedule_end` value, giving more nuanced control if needed. For further details, refer to the specific parameter descriptions below.

**Asynchronous Code Example**

```Pascal
//uses 
//  StabilityAI, StabilityAI.Types, StabilityAI.Common, StabilityAI.StableImage.Generate, 
//  StabilityAI.Version1.SDXL1AndSD1_6, FMX.Stability.Tutorial; 

  StabilityResult.FileName := 'lighthouse7.png';

  Stability.Version1.SDXLAndSDL.ImageToImageWithPrompt('stable-diffusion-v1-6',
    procedure (Params: TPayloadPrompt)
    begin
      Params.TextPrompts([TPromptMultipart.New(1, 'A dog space commander') ]);
      Params.InitImage('lighthouse6.png');
      Params.ImageStrength(0.45);
      Params.CfgScale(7);
      Params.Sampler(TSamplerType.K_DPMPP_2S_ANCESTRAL);
      Params.Samples(3);
      Params.Steps(30);
    end,
    function : TAsynArtifacts
    begin
      Result.Sender := StabilityResult;
      Result.OnStart := Start;
      Result.OnSuccess := Display;
      Result.OnError := Display;
    end);
```

>[!TIP]
> In our code example, the value of the Samples parameter is 3, which means that three images were generated. Only the first one is displayed. The other two were saved with indexed file names as follows: lighthouse701.png and lighthouse702.png.

<br/>

### Image to image with mask

Modify specific parts of an image using a mask. The mask must match the dimensions and shape of the original image. This functionality also supports images with alpha channels. 

use the mÃ©tode:
```Pascal
  ImageToImageWithMask(const Model: string; ParamProc: TProc<TPayloadMask>; 
     CallBacks: TFunc<TAsynArtifacts>);
```

<br/>

# Upscale

Tools to Enhance the Size and Resolution of Your Images

**Conservative Upscaler**
- Upscale images by 20 to 40 times while preserving their original appearance, delivering outputs up to 4 megapixels. This tool works effectively even with images as small as 64x64 pixels, directly scaling them up to 4 megapixels. Choose this option when you need a straightforward 4-megapixel result.

**Creative Upscaler**
- Designed for heavily degraded images (less than 1 megapixel), this service applies a creative approach to generate high-resolution outputs with a unique touch.

**Fast Upscaler**
- This quick and efficient tool is perfect for improving the quality of compressed images, making it a great choice for social media posts and other similar uses.

 <br/>

## Conservative

Accepts images ranging in size from 64x64 pixels up to 1 megapixel and enhances their resolution to 4K. More broadly, it can upscale images by approximately 20 to 40 times while maintaining their original details. The Conservative Upscale option focuses on preserving the image's integrity with minimal modifications and is not intended for reinterpreting the image's content.

**Asynchronous Code Example**

```Pascal
//uses StabilityAI, StabilityAI.Types, StabilityAI.Common, StabilityAI.StableImage.Upscale;

  StabilityResult.FileName := 'Upscalelighthouse1.png';

  Stability.StableImage.Upscale.Conservative(
    procedure (Params: TUpscaleConservative)
    begin
      Params.Image('lighthouse.png');
      Params.Prompt('The light house');
      Params.OutputFormat(png);
    end,
    function : TAsynStableImage
    begin
      Result.Sender := StabilityResult;
      Result.OnStart := Start;
      Result.OnSuccess := Display;
      Result.OnError := Display;
    end);
```

Detailed settings on the [official documentation](https://platform.stability.ai/docs/api-reference#tag/Upscale/paths/~1v2beta~1stable-image~1upscale~1conservative/post)

<br/>

## Creative Upscale

Accepts images ranging from 64x64 pixels to a maximum of 1 megapixel, enhancing their resolution up to 4K. More broadly, it can upscale images by approximately 20 to 40 times while maintainingâand often improvingâtheir quality. The Creative Upscale feature is particularly effective for heavily degraded images, but it is not suited for photos larger than 1 megapixel, as it applies significant reinterpretation (adjustable via the creativity scale).

>[!WARNING]
> This function is labeled as asynchronous by the editor, but in reality, it doesn't behave as such for a third-party application utilizing it. It operates more like a caching mechanism for a slightly delayed processing.
>

**Asynchronous Code Example**

```Pascal
//uses StabilityAI, StabilityAI.Types, StabilityAI.Common, StabilityAI.StableImage.Upscale;

  Stability.StableImage.Upscale.Creative(
    procedure (Params: TUpscaleCreative)
    begin
      Params.Image('lighthouse.png');
      Params.Prompt('The gray light house');
      Params.OutputFormat(png);
    end,
    function : TAsynResults
    begin
      Result.Sender := StabilityResult;
      Result.OnStart := Start;
      Result.OnSuccess := Display;
      Result.OnError := Display;
    end);
```

Detailed settings on the [official documentation](https://platform.stability.ai/docs/api-reference#tag/Upscale/paths/~1v2beta~1stable-image~1upscale~1creative/post)

We retrieve the job ID, and in the next step, we need to load the image unless the status retrieved is "in-progress." In that case, the operation should be retried.

### Fetch async generation result

```Pascal
//uses StabilityAI, StabilityAI.Types, StabilityAI.Common, StabilityAI.StableImage.Results,

  // e.g. Id ---> ea771536f066b7fd03d62384581982ecd8b54a932a6378d5809d43f6e5aa789a
  StabilityResult.FileName := 'Upscalelighthouse2.png';
  
  Stability.StableImage.Results.Fetch(StabilityResult.Id,
    function : TAsynResults
    begin
      Result.Sender := StabilityResult;
      Result.OnStart := Start;
      Result.OnSuccess := Display;
      Result.OnError := Display;
    end);
```

<br/>

## Fast

The Fast Upscaler serviceincrease image resolution by 400%. Designed for speed and efficiency, it processes images in approximately one second, making it an excellent tool for improving the clarity of compressed visuals, perfect for social media posts and various other uses.

**Asynchronous Code Example**

```Pascal
//uses StabilityAI, StabilityAI.Types, StabilityAI.Common, StabilityAI.StableImage.Upscale;

  StabilityResult.FileName := 'Upscalelighthouse3.png';

  Stability.StableImage.Upscale.Fast(
    procedure (Params: TUpscaleFast)
    begin
      Params.Image('lighthouse.png');
      Params.OutputFormat(png);
    end,
    function : TAsynStableImage
    begin
      Result.Sender := StabilityResult;
      Result.OnStart := Start;
      Result.OnSuccess := Display;
      Result.OnError := Display;
