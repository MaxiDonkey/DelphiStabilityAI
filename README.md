# Introduction

## Who is Stability.ai

`Stability.ai` is a well-established organization in artificial intelligence, known for its models that generate images and text from descriptions. Below is a summary of the key models they have developed, presented in chronological order of release:

Image Generation Models:

- `Stable Diffusion` (August 2022)
The first latent diffusion model, capable of generating images based on textual descriptions.

- `Stable Diffusion 2.0` (November 2022)
An updated version with improved image quality, support for higher resolutions, and additional features.

- `Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL)` (April 2023)
Focused on photorealism, this version introduced improvements in image composition and face generation.

- `Stable Diffusion 3.0` (February 2024)
Featuring a new architecture that combines diffusion transformers and flow matching, this version enhances performance for multi-subject queries and overall image quality.

- `Stable Cascade` (February 2024)
Built on the Würstchen architecture, this model improves accuracy and efficiency in text-to-image generation.

- `Stable Diffusion 3.5` (October 2024)
Includes variants such as Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large and 3.5 Medium, offering more options for diverse generation tasks with optimized efficiency.

## About this tutorial

This project provides a Delphi wrapper for integrating `Stability.ai’s` APIs into `Delphi` applications. It simplifies access to the capabilities of their **text-to-image** and **image-to-image** models.

The documentation begins with the most recent models and their features, gradually covering earlier versions to show the progression of the technology. While features from the initial API versions remain available, they may be deprecated over time, and the latest versions are recommended for future-proof integration.
